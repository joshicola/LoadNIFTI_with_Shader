#https://github.com/joshicola/LoadNIFTI_with_Shader

This project loads a NIFTI file and renders it with a RayTracing Shader presented in:
https://github.com/gillesferrand/Unity-RayTracing.git.

It can save the Volumetric Data in an asset file that loads much more quickly than a NIFTI file. However, saving the asset is a much longer process.

A video can be seen on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iTKcuQjeUc) using Stephen Keatings open data of his experience with an astrocytoma (http://www.stevenkeating.info/). The DICOM files were converted into a NIFTI file using the python library dcmstack.
